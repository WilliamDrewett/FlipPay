	<h1>About Us</h1>
	
	<p class="mb-6">
		We're reimagining what it means to swap tokens. In the spirit of web3, where users come first, transparency is default, and ownership is real, we're building a swapping experience that's fun, rewarding, and exciting.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-6">
		Every swap you make is more than just a transaction.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-6">
		It's a chance to win something instantly.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-6">
		It's a way to earn points every time.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-6">
		It's a path to games where everyone is a winner.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-6">
		Instead of passive fees and empty clicks, we turn swapping into a dynamic loop:
	</p>

	<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
		<li>Get lucky and your swap might be free!</li>
		<li>Earn points with every trade</li>
		<li>Use points to play games and win rewards</li>
		<li>Keep swapping, keep playing, the fun never stops</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="mb-6">
		There's no hidden randomness. All game mechanics are deterministic or verifiable. The system is built to be provably fair, fully auditable, and aligned with the values of open, trustless systems.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-6">
		We don't want you to just swap, we want you to enjoy every second of it.
	</p>
